## Create a log file
logfile=$(mktemp)

## Run your command and have it print into the log file
## when it's finsihed.
command1 && echo 1 > $logfile &

## Wait for it. The [ ! -s $logfile ] is true while the file is 
## empty. The -s means "check that the file is NOT empty" so ! -s
## means the opposite, check that the file IS empty. So, since
## the command above will print into the file as soon as it's finished
## this loop will run as long as  the previous command si runnning.
while [ ! -s $logfile ]; do sleep 1; done

## continue
